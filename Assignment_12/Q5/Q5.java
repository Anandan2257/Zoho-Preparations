/*Implement a basic producer-consumer problem using wait() and notify().
--->Producer thread should add items to a shared buffer.
--->Consumer thread should remove items.
Ensure the buffer size is limited to 5 items.. Use Threads to implement the ATM machine, where 
create thread to check the PIN number, another thread to perform the cash withdrawal, another 
one to check the balance amount and print the receipt. */
